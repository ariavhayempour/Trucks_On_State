# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **React with TypeScript**: Modern React application using functional components and hooks
- **Wouter**: Lightweight client-side routing library for navigation between pages
- **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui**: Utility-first CSS framework with pre-built component library for consistent design
- **Tanstack Query**: Data fetching and caching library for API state management
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server for fast development experience

## Backend Architecture
- **Express.js**: Node.js web framework serving REST API endpoints
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe server-side development
- **In-Memory Storage**: MemStorage class implements food truck data storage with seeded sample data
- **RESTful API Design**: Endpoints for retrieving food trucks, searching, filtering by category, and getting individual truck details

## Data Storage Solutions
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe SQL query builder configured for PostgreSQL
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL database (configured but not actively used, using in-memory storage instead)
- **Schema Definition**: Shared TypeScript schema defining food truck data structure with JSON fields for menu items and schedules

## Authentication and Authorization
- **No Authentication**: Current implementation has no user authentication system
- **Public Access**: All food truck data is publicly accessible without restrictions

## External Dependencies
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting service
- **Unsplash**: Image hosting service for food truck photos
- **Replit**: Development and deployment platform with specific Vite plugins for development environment
- **React Icons**: Icon library for social media and UI icons
- **Radix UI**: Headless UI components for accessibility and functionality
- **Date-fns**: Date manipulation library for schedule handling

## Key Design Patterns
- **Monorepo Structure**: Client, server, and shared code organized in separate directories
- **Shared Types**: Common TypeScript interfaces and schemas used across frontend and backend
- **Component Composition**: Reusable UI components built with shadcn/ui and Radix primitives
- **API-First Design**: Clear separation between frontend and backend with RESTful endpoints
- **Mobile-Responsive**: Tailwind CSS utilities ensure responsive design across devices
